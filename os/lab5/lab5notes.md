inlining a funciton is only a request to the compiler not a command

### Arrival Time:

the time at which the process enters the ready queue

### Burst Time:

the time required by process for CPU execution

### Completion Time:

the time in which process completes its execution

### Turn-Around Time:

turn around time = completion time - arrival time

### Wating Time:

waiting time = turn around time - burst time
